<p><strong>6) How did you discover the Web?</strong></p>
<p>Internet is a great public resources which extends oppurtunity, power, freedom, discover &amp; innovation. Web has given me the choice, opportunities to learn &amp; discover many new things that has built my knowledge, improved my career and developed my personality.</p>
<p><strong>7) How did you hear about Mozilla and Mozilla Tamilnadu Community?</strong></p>
<p>Mozilla Firefox has been my favorite browser. I am a great fan of it's rich &amp; varied add-ons. I came to know about the Mozilla Community through the FSA program while googling for existing Students Ambassador Program. Then Mozilla wiki came handy to learn about the community, how to contribute &amp; involve in building the community.</p>
<p>I was a part of the Mozilla tamilnadu community during the initial stages while it had very few countable contributors. With guidance of Reps from the Tamilnadu Community, I involved in recruiting many new FSA’s in and around tamilnadu. Thanks to the Mozilla reps from tamilnadu community. They were the reason why I’m here and a Strong community base in Tamilnadu.</p>
<p><strong>8) How and why did you start contributing to Mozilla?</strong></p>
<p>Initially I joined the program expecting to learn something new and stand out of the crowd in my College.Mozilla brand itself is something everyone would love to take part in. I enrolled to the program. Shreyas narayana kutty- Mozilla rep was the one whom i contacted first and met him in person. He helped me understand about the FSA program. He invited me to volunteer Mozilla Makerparty chennai.This was my first involvement. I then turned up to few meetups in Chennai. After few months of gradual involvement, I was guided by Viswaprasath-Mozilla rep from tamilnadu who was the key motivator for me to organize events and I started involving in Mozilla Activites with lot of passion and dedication.This was the turning point for me in my Contribution to Mozilla.</p>
<p>One thing i learnt from mozilla is “ have the passion to learn and a mind to share”.</p>
<p><strong>10) What’s the contribution you’re the most proud of?</strong></p>
<p>what gives more happiness than sharing knowledge to people and helping them develop their Skills &amp; personality. I cherish my Contribution in reaching the rural part of tamilnadu in teaching the power of web. Involving in Kidzilla activity in rural &amp; low income schools is always the most cherished memories.</p>
<p><strong>11) What advice would you give to someone who is new and interested in contributing to Mozilla?</strong></p>
<p>-Mozilla is not Just a Community. It is an opportunity where you get to learn &amp; Share things shaping your personal as well as professional growth all along building a free &amp; open web striving to achieve the Mozilla’s Mission.</p>
<p>-Ask other Mozillians for any sort of help. Mozillians are the best people in the world.</p>
<p>-Be passionate &amp; do your work with dedication, Recognition &amp; Rewards will come automatically.</p>
<p>-Internet is the best teacher. learn about Mozilla activities you can get involved, through Wiki docs. You have plenty of resources to start which is infact growing now, than we had few years back.</p>
<p><strong>12) If you had one word or sentence to describe Mozilla, what would it be?</strong></p>
<p>Empowers the user..</p>
<p><strong>13) What exciting things do you envision for you and Mozilla in the future?</strong><br />
