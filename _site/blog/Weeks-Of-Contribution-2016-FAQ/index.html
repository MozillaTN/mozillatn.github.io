  <li>Weeks Of Contribution (WOC) is an initiative started by MozillaTN contributors who were contributing to various Contribution areas of Mozilla.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is difference between last year and this year WOC?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Last year we used hangouts on Air, to broadcast to large</li>
  <li>This year all calls will be closed Google hangout and also presentation are shared audience. We are not able to focus dedicately to the people who were contributing.</li>
  <li>We didn’t have have trainers - Contributors like structure.</li>
  <li>We didn’t give letter of appreciation to anyone.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why we introduced Trainers this year?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>We have some goals and want to build MozillaTN community Stronger.</li>
  <li>We want to improve leadership skills of Students and expose them to great things.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What are Goals of This year WOC2016 ?</strong></p>

      <li>For QA, participating in Test days, finding bugs and filling 1 bug per contributor.</li>
      <li>For Add-ons developing 1 add-on per trainer.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Who are Trainers ?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Trainers are amazing contributors who had passion to teach their Friends in their College or City or Neighbours.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is Criteria to be Trainer?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Trainers need not be well trained contributor. We want People who can learn from others easily and teach it to others.</li>
  <li>Having a very Good blog to share what they have learnt (having blog in open source community is very important part of knowledge sharing)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When will the trainers be trained ?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Trainers will be trained 3 days before (Wednesday) the actual date of the session. So the plan as of now is  to train on Following dates for trainers

      <li>August 10th - Add-ons (using Web Extension API)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Is there content for trainers online or will we get some other form of tutoring?</strong>
- First mentor will train Trainers on Wednesday
- On The same day, the Presentations in the Mail for those who attended, so the same presentation can be used for Training other contributors Under Trainers.</p>

<p><strong>Where will we trainers do the WOC? In specific locations or our colleges or any place?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>WOC is fully a volunteer initiative, every one here are contributors, there can be different places to share knowledge. It is upto Trainer to choose any offline place.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is the goals of trainers in WOC?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The main goal is to introduce tools used in Open Source Communities. With respect to Localization and SUMO we are going to teach how the Localization is used in companies like Redhat, Mozilla and so on. Why it is important ?</li>
  <li>With respect to QA, we will be learning more about Manual Testing and how we will be filling the bugs in proper way.</li>
  <li>With Add-ons development we will be seeing how to develop Extensions for Firefox.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Should the trainers have any basic knowledge on the subject? (If so please enlist them in detail.)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>We expect Trainers need to having willingness to teach others &amp; writing blog as they learn and teach others</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Could the time schedule be made flexible in accordance with the trainers schedule?</strong></p>

      <li>July 16th to July 28th  - Firefox Nightly (QA)</li>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: In this dates we will track the impact of each contributor and so we can mention them in final stats &amp; but after this dates also contributors can continuously contribute and enrich their skills</em></p>

<p><strong>Is there any restriction on the number of contributors per trainer?</strong>
Yes, We Mentors (4) are planning to restrict upto 20 Trainers. We need to focus on all the 20 trainers so we can help easily. And also we want to Trainers to restrict themselves to 5-7</p>

<p><strong>What will Trainers be given at the end of Successful WOC 2016</strong></p>

<ul>

  <li>For Trainers alone we are planning to give recommendation on Linkedin</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Where will the mentors train the trainers?</strong></p>
