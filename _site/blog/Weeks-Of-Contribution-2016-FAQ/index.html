  <li>We didn’t have have trainers - Contributors like structure.</li>
  <li>We didn’t give letter of appreciation to anyone.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why we introduced Trainers this year?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>We have some goals and want to build MozillaTN community Stronger.</li>
  <li>We want to improve leadership skills of Students and expose them to great things.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Trainers are amazing contributors who had passion to teach their Friends in their College or City or Neighbours.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is Criteria to be Trainer?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Trainers need not be well trained contributor. We want People who can learn from others easily and teach it to others.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>When will the trainers be trained ?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Trainers will be trained 3 days before (Wednesday) the actual date of the session. So the plan as of now is  to train on Following dates for trainers

    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>First mentor will train Trainers on Wednesday</li>
  <li>On The same day, the Presentations in the Mail for those who attended, so the same presentation can be used for Training other contributors Under Trainers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Where will we trainers do the WOC? In specific locations or our colleges or any place?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>WOC is fully a volunteer initiative, every one here are contributors, there can be different places to share knowledge. It is upto Trainer to choose any offline place.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is the goals of trainers in WOC?</strong></p>

  <li>With respect to QA, we will be learning more about Manual Testing and how we will be filling the bugs in proper way.</li>
  <li>With Add-ons development we will be seeing how to develop Extensions for Firefox.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Should the trainers have any basic knowledge on the subject? (If so please enlist them in detail.)</strong></p>

Yes, We Mentors (4) are planning to restrict upto 20 Trainers. We need to focus on all the 20 trainers so we can help easily. And also we want to Trainers to restrict themselves to 5-7</p>

<p><strong>What will Trainers be given at the end of Successful WOC 2016</strong></p>

  <li>For Trainers alone we are planning to give recommendation on Linkedin</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Where will the mentors train the trainers?</strong></p>
