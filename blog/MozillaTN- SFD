**What is Software Freedom Day (SFD) ?**

**Software Freedom Day (SFD)** is an annual worldwide celebration for Free software organized by Digital Freedom Foundation. SFD is a public education effort with the aim of increasing awareness of Free Software and its virtues, and encouraging its use.
Software Freedom Day is celebrated worldwide on third week of September, with a goal to increase awareness about the free software and its uses.

What is Free Software ?
For computer programs that are covered by copyright law, software freedom is achieved with a software license, by which the author grants users the aforementioned freedom. Software that is not covered by copyright law, such as software in the Public domain, is free if the source code is in the public domain, or otherwise available without restrictions. They are 
    *Free to Use
    *Free to Study
    *Free to Distribute
    *Free to Modify
    *Free to Access
    *It's all about sharing.
  
**Why FOSS ?**

**Free and open source software (FOSS)** is one that respects your freedoms and makes its source code available. There prevails a chance as you are already using free and open-source software without even knowing it. In case you need more convincing, here are the undeniable reasons why you should start using FOSS now.
    *Freedom matters! (freedom to create, share, invent, collaborate, learn and modify).
    *Free of cost (not always but you always have choice).
    *Lots of choice, not only what to use but also how to use it.
    *It's the best way to avoid piracy.
    *It Builds Community
    *Computers last longer
    *Everybody can try and play.
    *Free software gives you control over your computer.
    *Foster real innovation and creativity.
    *It doesn't belong to any company, it belongs to us.
