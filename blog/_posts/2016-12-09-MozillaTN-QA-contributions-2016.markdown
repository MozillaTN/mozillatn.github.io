Whenever I post a message in our telegram group regarding the testdays,contributors actively respond to it.This active response is what drives me to host testdays.Their passion to contribute to Mozilla is high as sky. I am glad to contribute along with them. 

QA contribution is not just limited to Firefox. We participated in e10s compatibility testing for Firefox Add-ons in the form of an online sprint. This sprint went for week and many personally told me that it was fun to test add-ons.

12 amazing contributors participated in the sprint verifying 70+ add-ons. The complete list of verified add-ons and participants can found in the -[blog](https://mozillatn.github.io/blog/MozActivate-AMO-e10s-compatibility-sprint-result/) .

Later our awesome Womoz team called for another sprint. And they verified 30+ add-ons. The results can be in found in the -[blog](https://mozillatn.github.io/blog/Results-of-Womoz-Contribution-in-Featured-Add-ons-e10s-Compatibility-Sprint/).

With these contributions, we say a goodbye to 2016 and we will make more contributions to Mozilla in the coming year as a community.
