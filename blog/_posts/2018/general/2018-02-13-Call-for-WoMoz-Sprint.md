Hey Mozillians,

International Women's Day, March 8th is a global day seeks to celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women, as well as act as a catalyst for change when it comes to gender equality. Though many women are marking their achievements in various fields, we have women who fears to come out of their home.

We as **WoMozTN**(Women in [Mozilla Tamilnadu]({{ site.url }})) who are part of this technical world, strongly believe that it’s our responsibility to open the opportunity which we got to the fellow girls with this. With this spirit we are organising an event for girls on March. This is going to be one among the biggest event hosted **by Women and for Women**.
