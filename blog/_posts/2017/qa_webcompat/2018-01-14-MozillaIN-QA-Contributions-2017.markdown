Hello Mozillians!!

![QA Glimpse of 2017]({{ site.url }}/assets/qmo.jpeg)


Once we started to think, what we did for 2017? Every contributor of [Mozilla India](https://wiki.mozilla.org/India) starts to jump with joy, their mind had more traffic on remembering all the events they did, because it is much as a wide Sky. We have lot of contribution areas but 

**“We believe on quality rather than quantity counts”**

Now, it's time to show our quality. Mozilla India is very happy and excited to showcase our QA contributions to Mozilla.
In 2017, Mozilla India had **70+** vibrant number of contributors who worked with full fire throughout the year and participated on **100+** events. They actively involved themselves with huge passion in various QA bug events like [Bug Triage Day](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_Triage_Day), [Bug Verification day](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_Verification_Day), QA Test Day, [Reporting bugs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_writing_guidelines), etc on both offline and online. Our QA contributors doesn't stop here itself, they also want to teach the web to others. Several QA contributors organized bug events in their college campus club and brought many new contributors to the web. And they are responsible and playing a vital role in bringing up the count 71 this year.  We would like to thank [Ms. Krishnaveni](https://twitter.com/venikrishbm) for supporting us on creating etherpad for the bug events. Currently, we have **200** members in our MozillaIN QA telegram channel to share each other view on various QA projects going on. Mozilla India community wants to convey a special thanks to all of them for their hard work and supporting us in several ways.

Here is our proud 71 contributors

**"Women shouldn't be afraid to put themselves forward"** - *Sarah Wood*

We- The [Womoz](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WoMoz) did it!! To celebrate the International Women's day and women in tech, our QA contributors organized events with their respective campus club on March 8, 2017 and had hands-on in QA for women where many of them were non-mozillian and helped women students to join this huge community. 

During the month of May and June 2017, we organised a campaign called **[India Uses Firefox Nightly](https://wiki.mozilla.org/India/India_uses_Firefox_Nightly)** to target more power users for nightly in India which will bring stable Firefox build in future. Thanks to [Mr. Biraj Karmakar](https://twitter.com/birajkarmakar) who initiated this campaign in India. [Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1qJEkrT0AW8NzZrMHQ4bVpfZEE/view) says nearly **15** events was organized around India successfully and had a great social media impact. Mozilla India is proud to convey thanks to all the organizers for establishing this campaign in their local communities.

October was a very special month for mozilla, every mozillian consistently worked day & night for launching #newfirefox called Quantum. To test the power of Quantum, Mozilla community organized **[Firefox Quantum Sprint](https://firefoxsprint.mozilla.community/)** for its flexibility towards all the websites around the world. As a part of this happy moment, Mozilla India enthusiastically organized nearly **50** events around India and tested **1000+** compatibility sites.

In the end of the month we had a [QA call](https://fahimazulfath.wordpress.com/2017/12/24/qa-test-day-online-event/) for newbies to help them participating in QA Test Days.  In case you missed the call. you can watch the video in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV5zqYRQOU3lJ1zWsLS9OUYYjmHtkhc0x&jct=ijtCDC9slLtDSnHkyt-t7bKGgMvezA). 
 
That was an amazing time we had together as a community in the proud name of **Mozilla India**. No words to thank the community members for taken initiatives to achieve this metrics and for supporting us in all aspects. Last but not least Mozilla India would like to thank **Mr. Mihai Boldan**, **Mr. Mike Taylor** and **Mr. pasal Chevrel** for mentoring us. We are looking for tremendous powerful contributions from all of you in upcoming QA days.
