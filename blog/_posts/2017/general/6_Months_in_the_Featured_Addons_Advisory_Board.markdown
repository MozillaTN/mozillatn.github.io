Extremely happy for contributing in Add-ons featured board. 
I learnt a lot of things and was very cautious while giving my votes. Having been part of the board helped me earn a collection of 15 
compatible add-ons for my Firefox browser. The feedback that we people in the board gave, accounts to be of huge importance to the 
community. Moreover, I thank the Add-ons team of Mozilla for trusting me and for having given me this unique opportunity. Also huge thanks 
to Scott for the encouragement. A special note on Mozilla Tamilnadu team needs a mention here, for they always kept me in loop and helped 
me to understand my responsibilities.
