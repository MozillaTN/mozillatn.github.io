**What is Software Freedom Day (SFD) ?**

**Software Freedom Day (SFD)** is an annual worldwide celebration for Free software organized by Digital Freedom Foundation. SFD is a public education effort with the aim of increasing awareness on Free Software and its virtues, and encouraging its use. Usually Software Freedom Day is celebrated worldwide on third week of September.

**What is Free Software ?**

Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it refers to five kinds of freedom, for the users of the software:
        *Free to Use
        *Free to Study
        *Free to Distribute
        *Free to Modify
        *Free to Access
A software is a free software if users have all of these freedoms. Thus, you should be free to redistribute copies, either with or without modifications, either gratis or charging a fee for distribution, to anyone anywhere. Being free to do these things means that you do not have to ask or pay for permission.
  
**Why FOSS ?**

**Free and open source software (FOSS)** is one that respects your freedoms and makes its source code available. There prevails a chance as you are already using free and open-source software without even knowing it. In case you need more convincing, here are the undeniable reasons why you should start using FOSS now.
    *Freedom matters! (freedom to create, share, invent, collaborate, learn and modify).
    *Free of cost (not always but you always have choice).
    *Lots of choice, not only what to use but also how to use it.
    *It's the best way to avoid piracy.
    *It Builds Community
    *Computers last longer
    *Everybody can try and play.
    *Free software gives you control over your computer.
    *Foster real innovation and creativity.
    *It doesn't belong to any company, it belongs to us.
