Hello Mozillians,
Mozilla Tamilanadu is also one of the most active community in India


Social media is one of the most powerful weapons that is changing the way we perceive the world. With the aid of social media, we as a collective have become more connected than ever before. In that retrospect, social media is not exactly a media, but an interface to engage and build relationships with people. And we, the Mozilla TN social media team have focused on doing this for the past couple of months.

At the begining, MozillaTN Social media Team had only 3 amazing rulers guided by [Karthickeyan](https://twitter.com/hellokarthic)- Our Regional Ambassador Lead-

Our Interaction with the community people and contributors is mainly through the community websites. We in Mozilla Tamil Nadu always ensures that the works of our contributors reaches out to the common people as it can support and motivate many others. To achieve this reach out we cover the contributions of every contributor in the various area like Mozilla Localization, WebVR, Rust, Addons, WebCompat etc and publish it in our social media channels.  The relationship between contributor and community gets strong by this. Blogs are the main medium of communication as it can stand as a reference even in the absence of the writer.
