**What is Quality Assurance ?**

Quality assurance is an important part in the lifecycle of any software. This area include the following processes - Bug testing, bug filling, and  bug triaging. The Mozilla QA team drives software quality assurance activities across Mozilla and plays a key role in releasing a diverse range of software products on schedule.


**How will it help Mozilla Community?**

With millions of users to their products, the Mozilla community must ensure that the end users should not face any problems while using their products. Through the continuous process of QA, in which volunteers from all over the world participate, the products will be made bugless.

**Contribution Areas:**

- *Using nightly and aurora builds* - These are the unstable versions of firefox for android and Desktop. These versions generally have bugs. Using them will lead to discovering of bugs in them.

- *Filling Bugs in Bugzilla* - Bugzilla is a tool used by Mozilla to track bugs. The contributors must follow certain rules while filling a bug.

- *Bug Confirmation and Triaging* - Repeating the filled bugs to confirm its existence and Classifying the filled bugs into components.
