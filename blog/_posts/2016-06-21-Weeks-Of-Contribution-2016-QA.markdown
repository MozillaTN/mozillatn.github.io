**What is Quality Assurance ?**

Quality assurance is an important part in the lifecycle of any software. This area include the following processes - Bug testing, bug filling, and  bug triaging. The Mozilla QA team drives software quality assurance activities across Mozilla and plays a key role in releasing a diverse range of software products on schedule.


**How will it help Mozilla Community?**

With millions of users to their products, the Mozilla community must ensure that the end users should not face any problems while using their products. Through the continuous process of QA, in which volunteers from all over the world participate, the products will be made bugless.

**Contribution Areas:**
